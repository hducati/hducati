## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Henrique Ducati

### Hope you are well! Welcome to my profile

Passionate about programming and development, always looking for the next level and to give the best that I can. I try to constantly challenge myself, because I know it's a good opportunity to have new ideas and to evolve. Also, I really like to see ideas that help others and understand how they work... that's what captives me. ðŸ˜„
